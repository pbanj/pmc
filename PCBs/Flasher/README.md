# Picocenter  

~~files are currently not usable they are just there so the case can be made.~~  
The hat template is usable for those that want to make a hat for spacific boards.


Possibly the most over engineered flasher ever. Desinged to work with Picochu but can be used with anything you hook up to it.   
I'll be making different tops for the standard Pico, RP2040-0/Tiny, and various ESP boards.    

# Features:  

- WiFi  
- Auto updating the payload you're flashing to the Microvontrollers  
- A screen to tell you when it's finised or if it failed  
- Swapable hats for different RP2040 and ESP boards  
- Web UI  
- Can be set to pull the firmmware from differen't hosts
