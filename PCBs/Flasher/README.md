# Picocenter  

files are currently not usable they are just there so the case can be made.  

Possibly the most over engineered flasher ever. Desinged to work with Picochu but can be used with any pico you hook up to it.   
I'll be making different tops for the standard Pico, and the RP2040-tiny.  

# Features:  

- WiFi  
- Auto updating the payload you're flashing to the picos  
- A screen to tell you when it's finised or if it failed  
- Swapable hats for different RP2040 boards  
- Web UI  
- Can be set to pull Pico firmmware from differen't hosts   

All credits to @DefenderOfHyrule for firmware and loving my dumb ideas while high.
