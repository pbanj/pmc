# HM 5 contains flash

A little PCB to hold an LED for debugging.  
The BOM & Pick And Place are for useage with Picochu. 
But it can be used on it's own to add a debug led to projects.   
Prototypes came, made some adjustments. 
 
 
 
# Features  

- Two for one PCB design, just cut them in half.
- Single sided pcb outside of the gnd point.
- Spot for a cap or pulldown resistor on the voltage line.   
- A reversable pad setup so you can do either inline or pulldown resistor on the DIN line.  
- Ground is along edge so it can be used as an anchor. I did them facing the same way so castellated holes are cheaper if you want them.
- Minimum board size for OSH Park, can get 30 boards made for $4.00. Cut them in half and you have 60 boards.
