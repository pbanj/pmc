# pmc
An all in one solution for shocking your friends.   

Flasher, and chip for having a shockingly good time.  

So I got high one night and had the idea "Just how small can a one sided Pico be made and still work".  

I use picos for all sorts of projects around my house. So this was a way for me to see if I can make working Picos.  

So Picochu was born. The name started as a joke, but stuck when I couldn't come up with something better.  

It's so small that it needs a seperate flasher. That's where the Picocenter comes in. It'll be a self contained Pico flasher with WiFi, WebUI and a screen.  
It uses a esp32 so it can grab the latest firmware you tell it to. The screen will display info, status, errors, and ~~prob Doom~~.  
There will be different "hats" for it so it can be used to flash more than just picochu.    


I was able to shrink Picochu down to 10x18mm. I was also able to breakout more GPIO points for a total of 12. 

## This is still a major W.I.P

# Help fund current and future projects  

Now with all the cool stuff out of the way here comes the dumb stuff. Ordering prototypes is fairly expensive.  
The pcbs themselves are not too expensive, but the parts add up quick.  
So if you'd like to help with current/future projects here is my [Paypal](https://paypal.me/pbanj), [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/pbanj), and directly through my [Website](https://shop.pbanjin.space/product/tip).   
This will help get pcbs done faster.
