An all in one solution for shocking your friends  

Flasher, and chip for having a shockingly good time.  

So I got high one night and had the idea "Just how small can a one sided Pico be made and still work".  
I use picos for all sorts of projects around my house. So this was a way for me to see if I can make working Picos.  
So Picochu was born. The name started as a joke, but stuck when I couldn't come up with something better.
It's so small that it needs a seperate flasher. That's where the Picocenter comes in. It will be a self contained Pico flasher with WiFi, WebUI and a screen. It uses a esp32 so it can grab the latest firmware you tell it to. The screen will display info, status, errors, and prob Doom. There will be different "hats" for it so it can be used to flash more than just picochu.
